# Demand Forecasting using LSTM
---
## Problem Statement ~
>Every retailer must stay on top of planning activity to stand the demand of goods based on needs. A highly accurate demand forecast is the only way retailers can predict which goods are needed for each store location. This will also ensure high availability for customers while maintaining minimal stock risk and support capacity management, store staff labour force planning, etc. <br>
The project will use LSTM, which is very suitable for handling time-series data and widely
used for forecasting purposes.

## Dataset
> The dataset for this project is available on Kaggle.
